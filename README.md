# Bestiary

## Description

For this project, Team Goblin Mode created a bestiary that is intended to accompany a tabletop gaming platform. The purpose of the web application is to generate a monster with stats and saves it to a database. The user must login before they can access the monster creator tool. Once logged in, the user can input the monster stats and generate the monster. They will be able to see their created monster on the homepage. Plotly is an outside asset that the group utilized to visualize the monster stats. It is uniquely generated based on the monster it is representing.
